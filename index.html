      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        This tutorial explores current research and technology for automatically
        annotating soccer games with audio commentary tailored for blind and
        low-vision audiences. While TV broadcasts of games provide live
        commentary, this commentary does not provide the whole picture and
        commentators will often not mention details that make visualizing the
        game easier. Drawing from academic papers and real-world systems, we
        cover datasets, machine learning models, hardware for live commentary,
        and challenges in accessibility.
