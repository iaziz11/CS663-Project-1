      <h2>Challenges and Open Problems</h2>
      <p>
        While automatic commentary systems for soccer show great promise, there
        remain significant limitations across data collection, model accuracy,
        hardware delivery, and accessibility standards.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Dataset Limitations</h3>
        <p>
          Current datasets such as SoccerNet and MatchTime provide valuable
          resources, but they still face shortcomings. SoccerNet suffers from
          <em>caption misalignment</em>, where commentary may lag or lead actual
          play by several seconds [1]. MatchTime addresses this issue, but its
          coverage is limited to a smaller subset of matches. Positional
          tracking datasets, while precise, lack the visual richness needed for
          commentary. Furthermore, annotation remains extremely labor-intensive:
          <q
            >the high cost of manual annotation restricts both dataset size and
            diversity</q
          >
          [2].

        <h3>Model Performance</h3>
        <p>
          Even state-of-the-art models face challenges. Identifying individual
          players reliably across a 90-minute match is still unresolved. Models
          can confuse visually similar events (e.g., a
          <em>corner kick vs. free kick</em>) [1]. Ball detection remains
          especially difficult: its small size, rapid speed, and frequent
          occlusion mean that even YOLOv8, which performs well for players and
          referees, struggles with consistent ball recognition [3]. Vision
          Transformers improve robustness to lighting and jersey variation, but
          <em>their accuracy drops with low-resolution video</em> [3].

        <h3>Hardware and Delivery Constraints</h3>
        <p>
          Stadiums vary widely in their technological infrastructure. Some elite
          arenas are equipped with
          <em>high-speed Wi-Fi, FM transmitters, and accessibility services</em
          >, while others lack even basic broadcast infrastructure. This creates
          an equity gap: fans with access to high-tech stadiums or personal
          smartphones enjoy better services than those without. Battery life,
          connectivity, and device distribution all present practical barriers
          to reliable delivery.

      <section>
        <h3>Latency and Synchronization</h3>
        <p>
          Real-time commentary is only valuable if it is synchronized with live
          play. Even a 1–2 second delay between the action and the commentary
          can break immersion and render the system unusable for blind fans [1].
          Synchronization is especially challenging when broadcasting across
          multiple platforms (in-stadium devices, mobile apps, and streaming
          services) since each introduces its own buffering and latency.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Accessibility Standards</h3>
        <p>
          Despite progress, many solutions are not fully compliant with global
          accessibility standards. The
          <em>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)</em> [5] and
          FIFA’s <em>Accessibility Guide</em> [4] provide clear recommendations,
          yet implementation is inconsistent. Without universal enforcement,
          systems risk excluding users with varying degrees of visual
          impairment.
